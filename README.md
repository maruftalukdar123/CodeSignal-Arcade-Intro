# CodeSignal-Arcade-Intro
Going through the 'Intro' world in arcade mode on CodeSignal. Below is a description of all the puzzles I completed.

<h1>'The Journey Begins'</h1>
<h2><h2>

<h3>Add</h3>
Add two numbers

<h3>Century From Year</h3>
Given a year, return the century it is in. For example, if year is 1907, then it is the 20th century.

<h3>Check Palindrome</h3>
Given a string, check if it reads the same backwards and forwards, ignoring capitals and spaces. For example, Abba is read Abba backwards and is therefore a plindrome.

<h1>'Edge of the Ocean'</h1>
<h2><h2>

<h3>Adjacent Elements Product</h3>
Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product. For eample,

For `inputArray = [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3]`, the output should be
`solution(inputArray) = 21`.

7 and 3 produce the largest product.

<h3>Shape Area</h3>
A 1-interesting polygon is just a square with a side of length 1. An n-interesting polygon is obtained by taking the n - 1-interesting polygon and appending 1-interesting polygons to its rim, side by side. Find the area of a polygon for a given n.

<h3>Make Array Consecutive 2</h3>
Arrange array from smallest to larges, then find out how many more numbers is needed to make each entry of the array one bigger then the previous entry. For example:

For `statues = [6, 2, 3, 8]`, the output should be
`solution(statues) = 3`.

statues of sizes 4, 5 and 7 are missing.

<h3>Almost Increasing Sequence</h3>
Given a sequence of integers as an array, determine whether it is possible to obtain a strictly increasing sequence by removing no more than one element from the array.
